<h1 align="center">Delhi Air Quality Index Dashboard </h1>

### What is  Air Quality Index?
> The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a numerical scale used to measure and communicate the quality of air in a specific location. It provides an indication of how clean or polluted the air is and what associated health effects might be of concern for the general population.

### What is data analysis?
> The process of analyzing raw data to find trends and insights can be used to make decisions that benefit anyone. In data analysis, we perform various operations like obtaining raw data, organizing and cleaning it, storing it in an accessible place, modeling, and then analyzing data to extract insights that support decision-making.


### What tools are used in data analysis?
> Data analysts need many tools to gather insights from data. Important tools are listed below.
                     
  * **Python** :  Python is a programming language with a wide range of uses. It has a huge range of resource libraries suited to a variety of different data analytics tasks. For example, the NumPy and pandas libraries are great for streamlining highly computational tasks, as well as supporting general data manipulation. Libraries like Beautiful Soup and Scrapy are used to scrape data from the web, while Matplotlib is excellent for data visualization and reporting.
            
  * **Jupyter Notebook** : Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create interactive documents. These combine live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Jupyter Notebook runs in the browser and supports over 40 languages, including Python and R.
                          
## About the Project

>I have created a dashboard to visualize Delhi's AQI data for the past year. This dashboard provides an easy-to-understand view of the air quality trends over time, allowing users to monitor pollution levels across various parameters such as PM2.5, PM10, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide. It helps in identifying patterns of air pollution, detecting high pollution events, and understanding how air quality varies by location and season.
